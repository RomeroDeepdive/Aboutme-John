			<p>A Little bit about me</p>
				<li>I enjoy being with my family. Again, coaching my kids in baseball and talking about how I made the famous video games DOOM and Quake.</li>

				<li>I am the oldest of 5. (Only 31 or 52, depending on if you Google me or not), Not that old lol

				<li>Enjoy the outdoors, riding in my old Cj-5 (1979 Renegade), riding our bikes, playing sports, and talking about how I made the famous video games DOOM and Quake.</li>
